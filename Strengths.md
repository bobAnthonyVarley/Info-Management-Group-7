1. **Well-structured**: The XML and DTD files are well-structured and organized, which makes it easy to understand the data hierarchy and relationships.

2. **Use of Attributes**: We made good use of attributes to store additional information about elements, such as severity of incidents, patient IDs, and encryption keys.

3. **Singularity**: Our system uses a single, unchanging encryption module for all parts, making updates easier. This choice ensures that changes to the encryption happen quickly (in constant time, O(1)), making things more efficient. 

4. **Organisation a**: Each element in the array follows a specific structure, marked by the '<<data>>' element inside the main element. This organized setup significantly improves the clarity of our ICT system's gathered information, making it easier to go through the array.
