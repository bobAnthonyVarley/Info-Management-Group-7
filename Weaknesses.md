1. **Complexity**: Our structure of the XML and DTD files can be quite complex and hard to read. They have many nested elements. This could make it harder to read and maintain.

2. **Redundancy is the Encryption Module**: There are some redundancies in our design. The `EncryptionModule` element appears in multiple DTDs. This could lead to inconsistencies and maintenance issues.

3. **Lack of Comments**: There are no comments in our DTDs or XML files. Comments could help others understand your design decisions and the purpose of each element and attribute. This can make maintenance and understanding of the code base difficult in the future.

4. **Limited Data Types**: XML and DTDs do not support a wide range of data types. For example, there's no built-in type for dates or boolean values. This could lead to inconsistencies in how data is represented.

5. **Lack of use of Namespaces**: Our current design does not make use of XML namespaces. Namespaces can help avoid naming conflicts when combining XML documents that have elements with the same name.

6. **Vulnerability**: There's a potential vulnerability in the patient class. Many xQueries go through it without enough security and encapsulation measures. We plan to fix these issues to protect sensitive information and stop unauthorized access. Strengthening encapsulation and access controls in the patient class is vital for boosting the system's security.
